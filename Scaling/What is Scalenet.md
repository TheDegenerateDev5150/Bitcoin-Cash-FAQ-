[Scalenet](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/750) is a high-throughput blockchain testnet designed for stress testing and spamming to measure Bitcoin Cash software performance. It features a large default block size limit to allow GB blocks and encourages ASIC mining, allowing accurate explorations of mining dynamics. Scalenet is reset every 6-12 months to prevent storage costs from becoming unreasonable. A few years ago, Scalenet was used to mine [256 MB](https://read.cash/@mtrycz/how-my-rpi4-handles-mining-256mb-blocks-3ca73237) and [1 GB](https://read.cash/@mtrycz/how-my-rpi4-handles-mining-1gb-blocks-e5d09d83) blocks on a Raspberry Pi 4, showcasing the impressive throughput of the Bitcoin Cash network even on extremely modest hardware.

In contrast, [Testnet4](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/739#note_399231913) is optimized for convenience, offering a low-volume, quick-syncing blockchain with a 2 MB default block size limit, suitable for compatibility and feature testing. Both networks are intended to enhance testing capabilities for Bitcoin Cash development.
