[Cashonize](https://cashonize.com/) is a Bitcoin Cash web and desktop wallet. Cashonize offers support for CashTokens, the WalletConnect standard, and the BCMR metadata standard. Cashonize users can easily create new CashTokens in the wallet app. 

Cashonize utilizes WalletConnect to seamlessly integrate with apps like [Cauldron DEX](https://bchfaq.com/knowledge-base/what-is-cauldron/), a marketplace for instant token swaps or [TapSwap](https://bchfaq.com/knowledge-base/what-is-tapswap/), a non-custodial marketplace for CashTokens.

Cashonize also utilizes the new CashConnect standard for a better and more secure experience with dApps such as [BCH Guru](https://bch.guru/), a crypto price prediction platform.

The desktop version of Cashonize, available for Windows and Linux, can be found [here](https://github.com/cashonize/cashonize-quasar/releases/tag/v0.0.9).
