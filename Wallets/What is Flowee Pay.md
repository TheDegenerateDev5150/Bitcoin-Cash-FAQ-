[Flowee Pay](https://flowee.org/products/pay/) is a Bitcoin Cash wallet heavily focused on usability. Flowee Pay has introduced the idea of "modules" - optional add-ons to expand the functionality of the wallet. Currently there are two modules. The Create Transactions module allows for more powerful transactions in a simple interface. The Peers View module allows the user to view the nodes their wallet is connected to. More modules are expected in the future. Flowee Pay is available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.flowee.pay).
