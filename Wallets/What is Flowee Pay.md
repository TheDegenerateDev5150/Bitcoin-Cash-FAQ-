[Flowee Pay](https://flowee.org/products/pay/) is a Bitcoin Cash wallet heavily focused on usability. Flowee Pay has introduced the idea of "modules" - optional add-ons to expand the functionality of the wallet. Currently there are two modules:

* Create Transactions: allows for more powerful transaction building in a simple interface
* Peers View: allows the user to view the nodes their wallet is connected to. 

More modules are expected in the future. Flowee Pay is available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.flowee.pay).
