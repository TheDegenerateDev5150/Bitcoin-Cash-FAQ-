Paytaca integrates seamlessly with AnyHedge, a protocol that allows users to hedge or long their Bitcoin Cash positions against metals, fiat currencies, or other cryptocurrencies; all on-chain with no custodians. 

The Paytaca Chrome extension allows direct integration with certain applications and sites, such as TapSwap, a non-custodial marketplace for CashTokens. 

Paytaca utilizes WalletConnect to seamlessly integrate with apps like [Cauldron DEX](https://bchfaq.com/knowledge-base/what-is-cauldron/), a marketplace for instant token swaps or [TapSwap](https://bchfaq.com/knowledge-base/what-is-tapswap/), a non-custodial marketplace for CashTokens.
