[Paytaca](https://www.paytaca.com/) is a very capable Bitcoin Cash wallet with a lot of extra niche functionality. It integrates seamlessly with AnyHedge, a protocol that allows users to hedge or long their Bitcoin Cash positions against metals, fiat currencies, or other cryptocurrencies; all on-chain with no custodians. The Paytaca Chrome extension allows direct integration with certain applications and sites, such as TapSwap, a non-custodial marketplace for CashTokens. Paytaca has fully integrated CashTokens in the wallet. Paytaca is available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paytaca.app&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/paytaca/id1451795432), and on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/paytaca/pakphhpnneopheifihmjcjnbdbhaaiaa).
