Cryptocurrency exchanges are careful to make sure deposits are fully confirmed on the blockchain so that a customer cannot defraud them with a double-spend. Even after a confirmation, it is theoretically possible for an attacker to execute a miner-assisted double spend. Some exchanges base their confirmation requirement policies on proper risk analysis, but other exchanges do not. Many exchanges are apparently unaware that Bitcoin Cash blocks are completely irreversible after 10 confirmations. Therefore, any confirmation requirement longer than 10 confirmations is excessive. If your exchange requires excessive confirmations, contact them and request sensible policies.
