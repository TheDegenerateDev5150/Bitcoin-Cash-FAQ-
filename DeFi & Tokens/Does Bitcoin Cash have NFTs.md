# Does Bitcoin Cash have NFTs?


Yes. Since the CashTokens upgrade that occurred on May 15, 2023; native, miner-validated non-fungible tokens are now possible on Bitcoin Cash. Notable NFT projects include [BCH Guru](https://bch.guru/), [Bitcats Heroes Club](https://bitcatsheroes.club/), and [Emerald DAO](https://emerald-dao.cash/). NFTs, along with fungible tokens, can be traded on [TapSwap](https://tapswap.cash/).
