[CashTokens Studio](https://cashtokens.studio/), a recently launched tool, facilitates users in minting both fungible and non-fungible CashTokens. In the beta version of the software, users have the capability to generate various tokens and link them with logos, artwork, URLs, and other essential information. While dedicated documentation and user guides are currently unavailable, they are in development and will be provided in the near future. Users are invited to ask questions and receive guidance in the dedicated [Telegram channel](https://t.me/CashTokensStudio).
