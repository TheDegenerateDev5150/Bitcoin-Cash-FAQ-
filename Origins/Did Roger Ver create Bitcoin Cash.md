Roger Ver did not create Bitcoin Cash, nor was he involved in the Bitcoin Cash hard fork in any capacity. Ver had been an enthusiastic and extremely vocal supporter of Bitcoin since 2011 and was one of the first investors in Bitcoin-related businesses. 

During the scaling debates, Ver advocated for a bigger block size and supported the SegWit2x proposal, a compromise between small blockers and big blockers which would have introduced Segregated Witness into Bitcoin and then raised the block size to 2 MB. Even after the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, Ver was still advocating for SegWit2x. 

After it was clear the SegWit2x proposal was a bait-and-switch by Blockstream and other small blockers and that BTC would no longer be peer-to-peer electronic cash, Ver researched other cryptocurrencies and decided that Bitcoin Cash offered the best chance to deliver Bitcoinâ€™s original promise.
