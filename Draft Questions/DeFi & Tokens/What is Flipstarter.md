[Flipstarter](https://flipstarter.cash/) is a platform designed for voluntary funding of the Bitcoin Cash commons. It utilizes trustless, non-custodial assurance contracts to facilitate crowdfunding for public goods. The process involves creating a proposal, setting a funding goal, and allowing contributors to make trustless pledges. If the funding threshold is met by a specified date, the assured funds are automatically sent to the individual or group heading the proposal. The platform aims to enhance accountability and reliability in large-scale voluntary funding for Bitcoin Cash projects.
