As of 2021, the unconfirmed transaction chain limit on Bitcoin Cash has been [entirely eliminated](https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/unconfirmed-transaction-chain-limit/). Previously, the limit was increased from 25 to 50 in 2020 to provide more flexibility in certain scenarios. However, recognizing the inherent confidence that any valid Bitcoin Cash transaction would eventually be confirmed, the limit was deemed unnecessary, and it was removed in 2021. This change allows application developers to generate and broadcast chains of unconfirmed transactions of any length, with the assurance that they will ultimately be confirmed.
