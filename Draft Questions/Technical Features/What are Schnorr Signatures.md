[Schnorr Signatures](https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/2019-05-15-schnorr/), integrated into Bitcoin Cash in 2019, represent a cryptographic signature scheme used in both single- and multi-signature transaction types. This signature scheme serves as an efficient and versatile alternative to the traditional ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), offering several advantages.

Key features of Schnorr Signatures include:

#### Compact Size: 

Schnorr Signatures provide shorter signature sizes compared to traditional ECDSA signatures. This reduction in size contributes to more efficient use of space in blockchain transactions.

#### Faster Verification: 

The signature verification process with Schnorr Signatures is faster, leading to quicker transaction validations. This efficiency is beneficial for enhancing the overall speed and performance of the Bitcoin Cash network.

#### Aggregation Capability: 

Schnorr Signatures allow the aggregation of multiple signatures into a single signature. This feature not only improves scalability by reducing the size of transactions but also enhances privacy by combining multiple signatures into one, making it harder to discern individual participants in a multi-signature transaction.

#### Elimination of Transaction Malleability: 

Schnorr Signatures address the issue of third-party transaction malleability. Transaction malleability refers to the potential for altering the transaction ID without invalidating the signature. The elimination of this malleability simplifies the development of applications that require non-malleability, such as payment channels.

The integration of Schnorr Signatures into Bitcoin Cash marks a significant advancement in the network's transaction capabilities. It not only improves the efficiency and privacy of transactions but also expands the potential use cases for Bitcoin Cash by providing a more versatile and feature-rich signature scheme.
