Bitcoin Cash will likely not become a widely-used unit of account until it has millions or billions of users. That means, for the time being, goods and services are not priced in Bitcoin Cash, but are priced in the relevant national currency, converted to Bitcoin Cash at the current exchange rate at the point of sale.

Modern point-of-sale and wallet software makes transacting with Bitcoin Cash extremely simple for merchants and consumers.
