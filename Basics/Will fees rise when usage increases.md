Bitcoin Cash currently boasts a soft block size limit of 32 MB, significantly surpassing its current usage demands. The network exhibits the potential to grow by at least an order of magnitude without encountering any challenges. 

Anticipating the evolving needs of the future, developers have taken a proactive approach. In May of 2024, Bitcoin Cash is set to implement an [adaptive block size limit algorithm](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/ebaa). This groundbreaking algorithm will continually adjust the block size, maintaining a baseline of 32 MB, to accommodate the network's changing requirements. The upcoming update will empower Bitcoin Cash's block size to expand by as much as 2x per year. 

This innovative algorithmic approach, tailored to the network's needs, ensures that even amid substantial growth, Bitcoin Cash fees will consistently remain exceptionally affordable or will trend downward as the block size adjusts to the needs of the network.
