## Why Is r/btc About Bitcoin Cash Instead of BTC? Shouldn't the Bitcoin Cash Community Get Its Own Subreddit?

r/btc is a place where redditors are free to discuss any Bitcoin-based protocol and associated projects. r/btc was started in 2011, which was very early in Bitcoin’s history and six years before the Bitcoin Cash/BTC split. When r/Bitcoin began to suppress discussion of Bitcoin upgrades in 2015, many redditors flocked to r/btc where the discussion was not censored. Most of the uncensored Bitcoin community supported a continuation of Satoshi’s original vision of a scaled Bitcoin blockchain, which was eventually manifested in the Bitcoin Cash protocol. To this day r/btc does not censor any Bitcoin-related topics. Members of r/btc simply advocate more for Bitcoin Cash than they do for BTC. For redditors interested in a subreddit focused specifically on Bitcoin Cash, they are welcome to participate at r/Bitcoincash.
