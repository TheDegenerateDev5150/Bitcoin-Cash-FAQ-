# Is Bitcoin Cash centralized?


No, Bitcoin Cash is not centralized. There is no central point of control over the Bitcoin Cash network that can be abused or compromised. Just like BTC, there are many network nodes around the world running software to secure Bitcoin Cash and validate Bitcoin Cash transactions. In fact, the same entities that mine BTC also mine Bitcoin Cash. Anyone in the world is free to run Bitcoin Cash node software and/or mine on the Bitcoin Cash network. 

Additionally, Bitcoin Cash has an extra layer of decentralization that no other cryptocurrency has. There is no reference node implementation (i.e. official software). Instead, Bitcoin Cash has multiple independent node software teams that all collaborate and come to consensus on protocol upgrades. This ensures that no single organization controls the Bitcoin Cash network.
