There are a few people out there who claim that if Bitcoin Cash would change its name then it would be treated as an equal among other cryptocurrencies. Such people claim that Bitcoin Cash is trying to steal the Bitcoin name and thus poses itself as a threat to BTC. 

The fact is that Bitcoin Cash is a continuation of the original Bitcoin project started by Satoshi Nakamoto and has every right to the Bitcoin name. In any case, without any single entity in charge of the Bitcoin Cash project, it would almost certainly be an insurmountable task to convince a critical mass of the community to change the name.
