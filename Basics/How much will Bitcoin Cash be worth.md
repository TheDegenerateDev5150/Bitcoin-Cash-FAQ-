# How Much Will Bitcoin Cash Be Worth in the Future?

Nobody knows what the price of Bitcoin Cash (or any asset) will be at any point in the future. Its value is always based on supply and demand, which are constantly shifting. Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts generally have a positive outlook on the future price of Bitcoin Cash for at least a few reasons. One is that fiat currencies (e.g. USD) are inflating at a very rapid pace while the supply of Bitcoin Cash is limited to 21 million coins. Another is the belief that there will be an increased demand for cryptocurrency payments, especially among unbanked populations. Despite these beliefs, no one knows for certain how valuable Bitcoin Cash will be in the future.
