# How will Bitcoin Cash solve its volatility?

Volatility may or may not be a problem to be solved, depending on the use case. For example, many Bitcoin Cash users anticipate an increased value of their coins. To realize such hopes, volatility is a good thing those users embrace even though it includes the risk of Bitcoin Cash dropping in value. 

For merchants who accept Bitcoin Cash in exchange for goods and services, volatility may be undesirable as it could negatively affect their bottom line if Bitcoin Cash drops in price. In either case, it is not up to the Bitcoin Cash protocol to “solve” volatility. 

But there are services that can assist those looking to avoid volatility. Some users may wish to exchange their Bitcoin Cash for a stablecoin (e.g. USDT, flexUSD) when volatility is undesirable. Alternatively, those concerned about volatility can use [BCH BULL](https://bchbull.com/) (powered by [AnyHedge](https://anyhedge.com/)) to hedge the value of their Bitcoin Cash. The [Paytaca wallet](https://www.paytaca.com/) also integrates with AnyHedge, allowing users to hedge their Bitcoin Cash. While not yet implemented, the Bitcoin Cash payment gateway [prompt.cash](https://prompt.cash/) will allow merchants to automatically hedge their Bitcoin Cash revenue using AnyHedge contracts.
