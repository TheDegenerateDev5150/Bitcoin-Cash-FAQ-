## Who develops the Bitcoin Cash protocol?
<details><summary></summary>

The Bitcoin Cash protocol is not controlled by any single individual, institution, or development team. Anyone is free to contribute. A lot of the work is done as a collaboration between the six full node development teams and other independent developers. While not an official collaboration website (on Bitcoin Cash there is no such thing as â€œofficial), much of the collaboration on protocol and consensus work is done on [bitcoincashresearch.org](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/). Anyone can sign up and contribute to the discussions taking place there.
