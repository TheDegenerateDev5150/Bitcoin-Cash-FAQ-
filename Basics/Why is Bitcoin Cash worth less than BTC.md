# Why is Bitcoin Cash worth less than BTC when Bitcoin Cash has more utility?

The value of cryptocurrencies is completely up to supply and demand. At this point in time, there is simply more demand for BTC. 

For the time being, cryptocurrencies in general are mainly used as speculative assets rather than alternative currencies. While Bitcoin Cash continues the peer-to-peer cash design of Satoshi Nakamoto and BTC has abandoned that use case, BTC still enjoys name recognition and perception as the “original”. Therefore, the increased utility of Bitcoin Cash isn’t necessarily reflected in market prices. 

Of course, Bitcoin Cash users can benefit from its use cases no matter what the market price of Bitcoin Cash happens to be at any given moment.
