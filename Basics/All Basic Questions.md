## What is Bitcoin Cash? {: #what-is-bitcoin-cash }
<details><summary></summary>

Bitcoin Cash is a global, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that can be sent anywhere in the world, to anyone you want, without intermediaries. Bitcoin Cash is not controlled by any single entity and is instead secured permissionlessly by thousands of computers around the world dedicated to maintaining the network. Bitcoin Cash is decentralized so that no business, institution, or government can control it and no one can censor your payments. It is an alternative to government-controlled fiat currency that has been mismanaged and debased to an unprecedented degree. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, maintains a diminishing minting schedule and will forever be capped at 21 million coins. Bitcoin Cash offers anyone in the world the chance to enjoy financial sovereignty like never before.

## What’s the Difference Between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin?
<details><summary></summary>

Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin (BTC) used to be one and the same until August 1, 2017. That’s when the original network split and two separate coins were the result. At the moment of the split every owner of Bitcoin had the same amount of coins on both networks.

Since that time BTC has retained a 1MB “blocksize” (the space allowed for transactions every 10 minutes) even though transaction throughput had already reached a limit (about 300,000 transactions per day). The result is that BTC transactions can be quite expensive with the average transaction fee reaching as high as $50 at times. BTC transactions are also potentially very slow if you do not pay a high enough fee. Some transactions get stuck in limbo for days or weeks. To alleviate the problem of congestion and high fees, the BTC community hopes to rely on second-layer solutions (e.g. Lightning Network), only using the BTC network as a settlement layer or for very high-value transactions.

Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, upgraded its protocol to expand the blocksize. The Bitcoin Cash blocksize is fully adjustable with only soft limits in place. Bitcoin Cash developers  research and test larger and larger blocks, working to optimize the network and eliminate potential bugs. As market demand increases and protocol research progresses, the community works together to raise the soft limits on the blocksize over time. 

The result is that Bitcoin Cash transactions are extremely inexpensive and only cost a fraction of a penny for a typical transaction. This focus on inexpensive transactions opens up a world of payments-based use cases and allows for the possibility of onboarding millions of users and merchants.

## What Caused Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin to Split?
<details><summary></summary>

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin (BTC) shared a history until August 1, 2017. That’s when a “hard fork” happened which deliberately caused a network split. A hard fork is simply a change in the rules of the network to either add new features or to fix a bug. Some people refer to hard forks as “upgrades” and they don’t have to lead to network splits.

In this case, though, there was a longstanding disagreement over what network rules should be in place. Bitcoin had started to hit a scaling ceiling in 2015 and transaction fees were starting to creep up because of the congested network. Everyone agreed a solution was sorely needed. 

The cause of the congestion was due to a 1MB limit on the “blocksize” (the space available for transactions every 10 minutes or so). Bitcoin didn’t start out with an explicit blocksize limit but a 1MB limit was implemented early on to protect the young network from spam attacks that could overwhelm it (transactions were free in those days). The original design by Satoshi Nakamoto (creator of Bitcoin) called for simply expanding the blocksize as the network grew larger and more resilient.

However, the core group of developers that had managed to gain control of Bitcoin development by 2015 were unwilling to expand the blocksize. They claimed to believe that code workarounds and second-layer solutions could provide Bitcoin with the necessary scaling solutions. Many of these “small blockers” expressed the belief that high fees were actually good and desirable as a sign of Bitcoin’s high demand. An additional reason given to keep blocks small was to allow people with extremely limited hardware to still run a Bitcoin full node (a full node maintains the entire history of the Bitcoin blockchain). The small blockers claimed that, unless anyone of basically any means could run a full node, Bitcoin could not be decentralized as only a few big players could run nodes.

On the other side of the scaling debate, a significant portion of the Bitcoin community still believed in the original design plan of expanding the blocksize as the network matured, hardware became more capable and cheaper, and the userbase grew. This group of “big blockers” believed that Bitcoin could only fulfill its original purpose of being peer-to-peer electronic cash if blocks can easily accommodate current demand and transactions can remain extremely cheap. They also argued that second-layer solutions can only function well on a base layer that can be used inexpensively. Big blockers also took issue with the decentralization argument, maintaining that continual hardware advancements and other innovations would allow Bitcoin full nodes to be run affordably by anyone interested in doing so (while also making the point that users can just be users and do not have to run full nodes to use Bitcoin). 

The major Bitcon discussion forums were controlled by small blockers and became extremely censored, favoring arguments for keeping blocks small. Therefore, the mainstream narrative of Bitcoin ended up integrating those ideas. Bitcoin developers had been working on an upgrade called “Segregated Witness” (SegWit), a code workaround that would purportedly allow some additional transactions to be processed without raising the blocksize limit. SegWit would also allow for second-layer solutions to be implemented. 

While Bitcoin was preparing to upgrade to SegWit, a group of big blockers decided to hard fork a version of Bitcoin that would remain SegWit-free and follow Satoshi’s original scaling design. This version, named Bitcoin Cash (BCH), hard forked on August 1, 2017 at block height 478559 and introduced a completely adjustable blocksize with an initial soft limit of 8MB.

## Who Develops the Bitcoin Cash Protocol?
<details><summary></summary>

The Bitcoin Cash protocol is not controlled by any single individual, institution, or development team. Anyone is free to contribute. A lot of the work is done as a collaboration between the six full node development teams and other independent developers. While not an official collaboration website (on Bitcoin Cash there is no such thing as “official), much of the collaboration on protocol and consensus work is done on [bitcoincashresearch.org](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/). Anyone can sign up and contribute to the discussions taking place there.

## Who Created Bitcoin Cash?
<details><summary></summary>

Bitcoin Cash is a continuation of the original idea of Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash. Therefore it can be argued that Bitcoin Cash was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. A better question is probably, “Who forked Bitcoin Cash from BTC?”. 

The Bitcoin Cash hard fork was a collaboration among numerous individuals and development teams and its origins actually go back a few years before 2017.

## Is Bitcoin Cash Centralized?
<details><summary></summary>

No, Bitcoin Cash is not centralized. There is no central point of control over the Bitcoin Cash network that can be abused or compromised. Just like BTC, there are thousands of network nodes around the world running software to secure Bitcoin Cash and validate Bitcoin Cash transactions. In fact, the same entities that mine BTC also mine Bitcoin Cash.

Anyone in the world is free to run Bitcoin Cash node software and/or mine Bitcoin Cash blocks. Additionally, Bitcoin Cash has an extra layer of decentralization that no other cryptocurrency has. Bitcoin Cash has six independent node software teams that all collaborate and come to consensus on protocol upgrades. This ensures that no single organization controls the Bitcoin Cash network.

## How Much Will Bitcoin Cash Be Worth in the Future?
<details><summary></summary>

Nobody knows what the price of Bitcoin Cash (or any asset) will be at any point in the future. Its value is always based on supply and demand, which are constantly shifting. Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts generally have a positive outlook on the future price of Bitcoin Cash for at least a few reasons. One is that fiat currencies (e.g. USD) are inflating at a very rapid pace while the supply of Bitcoin Cash is limited to 21 million coins. Another is the belief that there will be an increased demand for cryptocurrency payments, especially among unbanked populations. Despite these beliefs, no one knows for certain how valuable Bitcoin Cash will be in the future.

## Will Bitcoin Cash Ever Be Worth More Than BTC?
<details><summary></summary>

The value of Bitcoin Cash is based on supply and demand and the economic interactions of millions of people. Therefore, it is unknown whether Bitcoin Cash can ever be worth more than BTC. Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts are generally of the opinion that one day Bitcoin Cash will be worth more than BTC. This opinion is mostly based on the fact that Bitcoin Cash transactions are far cheaper than BTC transactions (due to scaling efforts on the former) combined with a belief that the demand for cryptocurrency transactions will increase dramatically over the long term.

## Why Is Bitcoin Cash Worth so Much Less Than BTC When It Has Much More Utility?
<details><summary></summary>

The value of cryptocurrencies is completely up to supply and demand. At this point in time, there is simply more demand for BTC. At this time, cryptocurrencies in general are mainly used as speculative assets rather than alternative currencies. While Bitcoin Cash continues the peer-to-peer cash design of Satoshi Nakamoto and BTC has abandoned that use case, BTC still enjoys name recognition and perception as the “original”. Therefore, the increased utility of Bitcoin Cash isn’t necessarily reflected in market prices. Of course, Bitcoin Cash users can benefit from its use cases no matter what the market price of Bitcoin Cash happens to be at any given moment.

## How Can Bitcoin Cash Be Used as Cash if I Have to Wait 10 Minutes or More for a Confirmation?
<details><summary></summary>

With Bitcoin Cash you do not have to wait for a confirmation for the vast majority of transactions. 

Bitcoin Cash transactions are confirmed in blocks of transactions that get added to the blockchain every ten minutes, on average. When a transaction is confirmed in a block, it is proof that a significant amount of electricity has been expended to include that transaction. In addition, even more electricity would be needed to reverse it. The electricity required to reverse an already-confirmed transaction can always be used much more profitably to simply extend the blockchain further, rather than reversing previous transactions. That makes the reversal of transactions that have already been confirmed extremely unlikely. 

What sets Bitcoin Cash apart is its dedication to scaling. Because of that there is always plenty of room for transactions to be included in the next block. That is different from many other cryptocurrencies, including BTC, that are congested and require transactions to compete and pay inordinate fees to be included in the next block. Thus every transaction on Bitcoin Cash is nearly guaranteed to be included in the next block. This gives Bitcoin Cash something called zero-confirmation (0-conf) security. It means that a transaction that gets broadcasted across the network is nearly as good as a confirmed transaction. 

0-conf security is definitely not absolute. It is technically possible for a miner (or someone colluding with a miner) to stealthily double-spend a transaction. But such schemes are only profitable with very large amounts. Therefore, any transaction worth less than $1000 USD (and possibly much more than that) should be just fine to accept without any confirmations. 

Of course any business or exchange is free to set their own 0-conf policies. Some exchanges require multiple confirmations before crediting deposited amounts. However, not all businesses or exchanges base their policies off of actual risk or hard data.

## How Will Bitcoin Cash Solve Its Volatility?(#how-will-bitcoin-cash-solve-its-volatility)
<details><summary></summary>

Volatility may or may not be a problem to be solved, depending on the use case. For example, many Bitcoin Cash users anticipate an increased value of their coins. To realize such hopes, volatility is a good thing those users embrace even though it includes the risk of Bitcoin Cash dropping in value. For merchants who accept Bitcoin Cash in exchange for goods and services, volatility may be undesirable as it could negatively affect their bottom line if Bitcoin Cash drops in price. In either case, it is not up to the Bitcoin Cash protocol to “solve” volatility. But there are services that can assist those looking to avoid volatility. Some users may wish to exchange their Bitcoin Cash for a stablecoin (e.g. USDT, flexUSD) when volatility is undesirable. Alternatively, those concerned about volatility can use [Detoken](https://detoken.net) (powered by [AnyHedge](https://anyhedge.com/)) to hedge the value of their Bitcoin Cash. While not yet implemented, the Bitcoin Cash payment gateway [prompt.cash](https://prompt.cash/) will allow merchants to automatically hedge their Bitcoin Cash revenue using AnyHedge contracts.

## Why Is r/btc About Bitcoin Cash Instead of Bitcoin? Shouldn't the Bitcoin Cash Community Get Their Own Subreddit?
<details><summary></summary>

r/btc is a place where redditors are free to discuss any Bitcoin-based protocol and associated projects. r/btc was started in 2011, which was very early in Bitcoin’s history and six years before the Bitcoin Cash/BTC split. When r/Bitcoin began to suppress discussion of Bitcoin upgrades in 2015, many redditors flocked to r/btc where the discussion was not censored. Most of the uncensored Bitcoin community supported a continuation of Satoshi’s original vision of a scaled Bitcoin blockchain, which was eventually manifested in the Bitcoin Cash protocol. To this day r/btc does not censor any Bitcoin-related topics. Members of r/btc simply advocate more for Bitcoin Cash than they do for BTC. For redditors interested in a subreddit focused specifically on Bitcoin Cash, they are welcome to participate at r/Bitcoincash.

## Did Bitcoin Cash Steal the Bitcoin Name?
<details><summary></summary>

The idea of stealing the name “Bitcoin” implies that the Bitcoin name is or can be owned. Ignoring the question of whether intellectual property actually exists at all, the use of the Bitcoin name to describe open-source protocols has been fair game since the invention of Bitcoin. Bitcoin was originally released under the MIT license, which is extremely permissive. Multiple cryptocurrencies have used the Bitcoin name and we should expect more of that in the future. When BTC and Bitcoin Cash split, that was the first time the Bitcoin name was used by two cryptocurrencies simultaneously. Many BTC enthusiasts felt that Bitcoin Cash was stealing the name while Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts thought it was absolutely justified since Bitcoin Cash continued the original project Satoshi Nakamoto started. In any case, any cryptocurrency is certainly free to use the Bitcoin name.

## Why Doesn't Bitcoin Cash Change Its Name?
<details><summary></summary>

There are a few people out there who claim that if Bitcoin Cash would change its name then it would be treated as an equal among other cryptocurrencies. Such people claim that Bitcoin Cash is trying to steal the Bitcoin name and thus poses itself as a threat to BTC. The fact is that Bitcoin Cash is a continuation of the original Bitcoin project started by Satoshi Nakamoto and has every right to the Bitcoin name. The name of Bitcoin Cash is not going to change at this point and anyone suggesting it should is advocating the introduction of much confusion into the cryptocurrency space.

## Did Roger Ver Create Bitcoin Cash?
<details><summary></summary>

Roger Ver did not create Bitcoin Cash, nor was he involved in the Bitcoin Cash hard fork in any capacity. Roger had been an enthusiastic and extremely vocal supporter of Bitcoin since 2011 and was one of the first investors in Bitcoin-related businesses. During the scaling debates, Roger advocated for a bigger blocksize and supported the SegWit2x proposal, a compromise between small blockers and big blockers which would have introduced Segregated Witness into Bitcoin and then raised the blocksize to 2MB. Even after the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, Roger was hoping for the second part of SegWit2x to be implemented. After it was clear the SegWit2x proposal was a bait-and-switch by small blockers and that BTC could no longer be peer-to-peer electronic cash, Roger researched other cryptocurrencies and decided that Bitcoin Cash offered the best chance to deliver Bitcoin’s original promise.
