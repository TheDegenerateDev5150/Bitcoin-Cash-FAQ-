# What advancements has Bitcoin Cash made to the Bitcoin Script virtual machine?


Since Bitcoin Cash split from BTC, it has upgraded the Bitcoin Script VM in numerous ways. Such improvements include numerous reenabled opcodes, many new opcodes, malleability fixes, Schnorr signatures, Schnorr signatures for multisig, multiple OP_RETURNs, 64-byte integer support, native introspection, and CashTokens (native consensus-enforced UTXO fungible and non-fungible token primitives and related opcodes). A fairly comprehensive list of all the Bitcoin Script VM changes can be found in [this stackexchange answer](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/41906/any-innovations-in-altcoin-tech-for-bitcoin-s-script-language).
