Multisignature wallets, often abbreviated as multisig wallets, are a type of cryptocurrency wallet that requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. This adds an extra layer of security compared to traditional single-signature wallets, where only one private key is needed to access and control the funds.

In a multisig setup, the wallet is associated with multiple sets of public keys, and a predefined number of the matching private keys are required to sign a transaction for it to be considered valid. The configuration is often denoted as "m-of-n," where "m" represents the minimum number of signatures required, and "n" is the total number of public keys associated with the wallet.

For example, in a 2-of-3 multisig wallet, there are three public keys, and any two of them are needed to authorize a transaction. This introduces redundancy and improves security in various scenarios:

#### Enhanced Security: 

If one private key is compromised, the funds remain secure unless an attacker gains access to the required number of keys.

#### Shared Control: 

Multisig wallets are commonly used in shared ownership scenarios, where multiple individuals or entities jointly control the funds. For instance, a business may use a 2-of-3 multisig wallet, requiring approval from at least two company executives for transactions.

#### Escrow Services: 

In financial transactions or smart contracts, multisig wallets can be used as escrow, ensuring that a certain number of participants agree before funds are released.

The use of multisig wallets adds complexity but significantly enhances the security and trust model in various cryptocurrency applications.
